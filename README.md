# Registrar
A unit within the University was in need for a simplified site layout. The purpose was to address finding content when the user wanted to apply for studies. 

To cater for this, a single page design was opted for.  The single page was then sectioned to allow for easy organisation of content. This allowed users to find it consistently and in a timely a manner.  

## What was used
Simple design was utilised that extracted information from a list in SharePoint and populate date on the page. JavaScript in conjunction with Bootstrap was utilised.

## Who was involved
The unitâ€™s content manager was involved in assigning to content owners the aggregation of content. It was my responsibility to design and develop the site.

## Continued support
After the product was delivered an ongoing support was rendered to support the client.
