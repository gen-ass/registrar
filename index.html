                        <strong>Important information - New applicants</strong><br><br>
                        The university requires all undergraduate entrants to write the National Benchmark Test (NBT). More information as to dates, venues, tests, registration, and 
                        costs is available from the NBT website at <a href="http://www.uj.ac.za/nbt">www.uj.ac.za/nbt</a>
                        In the case of applicants re-writing Grade 12 subjects, applications will be processed on the current results available. If Grade 12 has been written more than once then your combined results must be submitted with your application.
                        Applicants writing the National Senior Certificate (NSC) through IEB or SACAI examining bodies can apply online by selecting "National Senior Certificate" 
                        under the Results Detail page of the online application process.
                        Applicants currently in Grade 12 may be requested to provide certified copies of final Grade 11 results for verification and auditing purposes.
                        Applicants may only apply for two study choices. These study choices can't be amended once they have been chosen.
                        Knowing the qualification requirements will avoid disappointment when applying. Therefore, ensure you consult with the 2017 Undergraduate Prospectus when
                        completing your application.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Applicants may only apply for two study choices. These study choices may not be amended once they have been chosen.
                        The University of Johannesburg requires all undergraduate entrants to write the National Benchmark Test (NBT). More information as to dates, venues, 
                        tests, registration, and costs is available from the NBT website www.uj.ac.za/nbt  
                        If you are currently re-writing a South African Grade 12, please note that we can only process your application on the current results we have available. 
                        If Grade 12 has been written more than once then your combined results must be uploaded at the end of your application process.      
                        If you are currently in your final year of study outside the borders of the Republic of South Africa then unfortunately you cannot apply for the 
                        2017 application cycle.   
                        Applicants will only be able to apply for a study visa upon the receipt of an admission letter from the University of Johannesburg.  
                        International applicants currently studying towards a South Africa Grade 12 may be requested to provide certified copies of final Grade 11 results 
                        for verification and auditing purposes.  
                        Final school-leaving results (applicants who have completed High School/Secondary Education) must be submitted with application. 
                        Diploma applicants are required to apply with their final school-leaving results and an exemption certificate from HESA is not required.

Recognition of Prior Learning

                        <strong>1. WHAT IS RECOGNITION OF PRIOR LEARNING (RPL)?</strong>
                        <br>
                        <br> RPL is “the comparison of previous learning and experience of a student, howsoever obtained, against the learning outcomes required for a specific qualification and the acceptance of such learning for purposes of qualification
                        of that which meets the requirements” (SAQA Regulation 452, No 18787, March 1998:5).
                        <br>
                        <br> This means that you can apply for RPL if you have developed skills and knowledge through work experience. Learning from experience refers to work experience, in-service training, self-study or life experience such as voluntary
                        or community work.
                        <br>
                        <br> It is a process to recognise relevant knowledge and skills that can lead to access to a postgraduate programme at the UJ or to credits for a module in a programme offered by UJ.
                        <br>
                        <br> According to the Higher Education Qualifications Sub-framework (January 2013), postgraduate programmes include the following:
                        <br>
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>Postgraduate Diploma
                        <br> Bachelor Honours Degree
                        <br> Master’s Degree
                        <br> Professional Master’s Degree
                        <br> Doctoral Degree
                        <br> Professional Doctorate
                        <br> You are advised to consult the UJ Yearbook on the kinds of qualifications this University offers. Recognition of prior learning can only be done for a programme that the UJ offers</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br> When applying for RPL, you have to indicate whether you are applying for (i) access to a programme, (ii) credits or (iii) advanced standing.
                    <br>
                    <br> These concepts are defined as follows:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote><strong>Access</strong> means that you want to enrol for a programme, but you do not meet the minimum requirements. As part of your RPL application, you have to prove that you have acquired the required skills and knowledge (i.e. competence)
                        through work experience.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Credits</strong> refer to the formal credit value of a module(s). In your RPL request you have to provide evidence that you have, through work experience, acquired the competence as described in the outcomes of that particular
                        module. If your RPL application is successful, the credits may be allocated to you and you do not have to attend lectures or write exams in this specific module.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Advanced standing</strong> means that you have acquired some of the competences described in the outcomes of the programme for which you want to/have enrol. If your RPL application is successful, you do not have to repeat
                        (i.e. attend lectures, write exams or any other form of assessment) the particular section of the programme.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>2. WHAT IS NOT RPL?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br> The following requests do NOT qualify as RPL:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>Status for a qualification obtained outside South Africa.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br> If you have an existing qualification (from another higher education institution) and would like to continue your studies in the same discipline, you do NOT go through the RPL process. You follow the normal process of application.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>Credits for a module completed at another university or another UJ department.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br> The following examples are NOT RPL:
                    <br>
                    <br> You have successfully completed a module as part of another programme at the UJ, or as part of a programme offered by another South African University.
                    <br>
                    <br> You may request the recognition of the credits for this module as part of a different programme at the UJ. Your application for credits follows the prescribed process for exemption. (Refer them to??)
                    <br>
                    <br> However, if you have the module outcomes through experience (i.e., not through formal studies) a formal RPL assessment may be conducted to assess your competence in a particular module. In other words, it then becomes an RPL application.
                    <br>
                    <br> Obtaining a qualification without registering for it.
                    <br>
                    <br> RPL is NOT a process through which you can obtain a qualification without registering and studying for it. You can gain access to a programme through RPL, but a qualification is NOT granted on the basis of RPL alone. Only status is
                    granted if you do not have the required qualification to gain access to a programme.
                    <br>
                    <br> Example: You need an Honours degree to gain access to a Master’s programme. You do not have an Honours Degree, but after an RPL assessment process are found to possess the knowledge and skills that are required of an Honours student,
                    you may then gain access to the Master’s programme. You do not receive an Honours degree, but the status of an Honours degree is allocated on condition that you continue your Master’s studies at the UJ.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>3. WHAT ARE THE PRINCIPLES OF RPL?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br> The following principles are applicable to RPL practices at the University:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>Recognition of prior learning allows access to further (postgraduate) study by granting the status, but not the award of the prerequisite qualification.
                        <br> The UJ does not accept any form of RPL assessment undertaken by any other institution.
                        <br> Any recognition of prior learning granted is valid only for the period specified by the relevant Faculty.
                        <br> Admission to the UJ, based on RPL, is subject to the rules and regulations of the University.
                        <br> Recognition is given only for current competence, as determined by the relevant Faculty.
                        <br> RPL is programme-specific: recognition is given only for learning that is aligned to the learning outcomes and assessment criteria of a specific programme or module, and not primarily the content.
                        <br> As an applicant, you will undergo a formal RPL process that usually involves a lengthy process – it is not a not a single event.
                        <br> You will have to provide evidence (e.g. portfolios, challenge examinations, etc.) that must be assessed as relevant, sufficient, authentic and current.
                        <br> Quality assurance processes guarantee the integrity and credibility of all aspects of the RPL process.
                        <br> Two fees are payable: firstly, an RPL Request Fee (UJ Application Fee), and secondly an RPL Assessment Fee (where applicable).
                        <br> If you are not satisfied with the outcome of any stage of the RPL process, you can appeal the Executive Dean of the relevant faculty.
                        <br> Once registered for a programme, you become a member of the student body and all academic rules and regulations apply.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Important information</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <blockquote>RPL is a lengthy process. Depending on the level of study, it can take many months to go through the RPL process.
                        <br> To go through the whole RPL process will require the payment of different fees, namely an RPL Request Fee of R200.00, and an RPL Assessment Fee payable if the request is submitted to a formal assessment process. This RPL Assessment
                        Fee is the equivalent of the relevant module for which an RPL request has been submitted.
                        <br> The applicant cannot obtain a qualification through RPL - only through the successful completion of the programme will a student obtain a qualification.
                        <br> The UJ does not accept any previous RPL assessments that may have been done at or by another institution, regardless of why or when such assessments may have been done.</blockquote>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Will I qualify for Recognition of Prior Learning?</strong>
                    <br>
                    <br> Do you want access/credits to a postgraduate programme (i.e. a Postgraduate Diploma, Bachelor Honours Degree, Master's Degree, Professional Master's Degree, Doctoral Degree or a Professional Doctorate) through work experience?
                    <br>
                    <br> YES or NO
                    <br>
                    <br> Is your learning from experience related to the postgraduate programme that you would like to enrol for?
                    <br>
                    <br> YES or NO
                    <br>
                    <br> Please follow the application process below if you answered YES to both questions above. If you answered NO to any one of the two questions above, then unfortunately you do not qualify for RPL.
                    <br>
